# reactkit 

> Just a prototype of how to render react components with a node server and php.

## setup

1. clone git repo
2. run `yarn` in `frontend` directory
3. run `composer update` in `reactkit` directory
4. start node server `npm run server` in `frontend` directory (port 3000)
5. build react app in `frontend` directory by running `npm run build`
6. open `index.php` in your browser somehow.
7. now you should see your react component on the site and the button should work.
